This is a simplified model of various planetary systems. We included four exoplanetary systems and our own solar system. Each star system is unique. We used a lot of 
simplification, like applying two-body newtonian gravity only, animating circular orbits and not elliptical ones, and ignoring many body interactions.

It is meant to be very visual, intuitive and engageing. However, you can still learn a lot about the star and the planets by reading the plentiful amount of information at the 
bottom of the screen. 

And, just for fun, we added a little rocket that you can fly around the planetary system with.

This program's target audience is elementary school students. This can teach them about gravity, our solar system, seasons, and even the rest of our universe.
